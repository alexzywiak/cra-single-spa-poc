# cra-single-spa-poc
Acronym laden proof of concept for using customised CRA with single-spa

I copied `react-scripts` out and hacked the necessary pieces.  A tangible POC that this can be done by ejecting, forking, rewiring etc.

## Running

In run `yarn start` in each of the application directories as well as root-config.  Visit `localhost:9000`.  Refresh the page to update any changes from the other applications.
